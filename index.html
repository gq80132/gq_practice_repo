                    For the second week in a row Rafael Navarro has been named to MLS's Team of the Matchday for his
                    skill in front of goal, this time for notching the Rapids' lone goal in Austin to propel his team to
                    its first three-point performance of the season.
                    The Brazilian striker made the difference for Colorado in the 18th minute at Q2 Stadium, as
                    midfielder Djordje Mihailovic split the Austin backline for Navarro's run in behind to face
                    goalkeeper Brad Stuver one on one. His chip over Stuver floated into the back of the net for the
                    only goal of the match.
                </p>
